# useMemo & useCallback

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# useMemo VS useCallback: 

- Allows you to optimize the performance of your React application by `memoizing` expensive computations. 

- Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated. 

- The useMemo hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.

- The useMemo and useCallback hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.
