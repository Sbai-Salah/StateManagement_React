# useEffect

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

---

-  allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers

- The useEffect hook accepts two arguments. 


- The second argument is optional. useEffect (<function>, <dependency>). 

- The first argument is a function that will be executed after every render. 
  
- The second argument is an array of dependencies that will trigger the effect when they change

- useEffect is not a lifecycle hook. It's a mechanism for synchronizing side effects with the state of your app.
